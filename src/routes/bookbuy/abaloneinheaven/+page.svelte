            Abalone lay in his bed, surrounded by his family. They had gathered around him, knowing that his time on earth was coming to an end. Abalone had been battling a long illness, and he had fought hard, but his body was tired, and it was time to say goodbye. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Abalone's family was heartbroken. They had watched him suffer for so long, and now they had to let him go. They held his hand, stroked his hair, and whispered words of love and comfort. Abalone's wife, children, and grandchildren all came to say their goodbyes. They knew that they had been blessed to have Abalone in their lives, and they would always cherish the memories they had made together.
