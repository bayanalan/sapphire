They've traveled far and wide, from the bustling streets of New York to the rugged canyons of Arizona, and the wide-open plains of Texas. They've faced many challenges and mishaps on their journeys, but nothing has ever stopped them from pursuing their love of exploration.

            Jeremiah, on the other hand, is a more cautious and analytical cricket. He likes to think things through carefully before making a move, but he's always willing to go along with Pickles' plans if it means having an exciting adventure.
